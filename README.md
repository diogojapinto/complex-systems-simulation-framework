# Complex Systems' Simulation Framework

## Synopsis

This project aims to provide a reusable and extensible tool for behavior analysis in complex systems to the scientific community (namely in the field of CPS). That system is to support:
 * a real-time simulation environment for complex systems, fed from a data stream;
 * induction of resource's behaviors from the data stream;
 * definition of behaviors through a DSL\footnote{Domain-Specific Language};
 * analysis over different layers of the complex system (individual, sub-graphs and global);
 * provide predictions of future events;
 * scale to reasonably-sized complex systems;
 * enable features' extension through additional modules.

An extended description is found in my thesis monograph, available [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B1dcMiva9KZvTFUxX1gzYlhGYXM/view?usp=sharing).

## Code Example

As the development progresses, here I will showcase a simple use-case of the framework, in the context of Cyber-Physical Systems (Internet of Things).

## Motivation

Even though humans achievements are due to their particular way to reason about the world, with approximations, simplifications and derivations, complexity always amazed us, with its deceivingly simple base rules and unforeseen consequences. Many are the systems of individuals found in natures in which the result of of their activities is higher than the sum of its parts, as is the example of ants behavior when searching for food: their search method is very efficient, even though each individual only obeys a simple restricted set of rules.

These systems underlie great value, but the complexity that arises from them is hard to analyze and comprehend. As such, much of the potential for improvement is out of reach of existing tools. In this context, project to provide a tool that helps to reason over the behaviors and interactions that take place in a given complex system. By answering the questions "what is happening", "what will happen", and "what would happen if", the knowledge gathered simplifies the system of interactions in such a way that insight can be harnessed, and therefore, action can be taken.

## Installation

Here will be provided information on how you can instantiate this framework in your specific environment.

## API Reference

As implementation evolves, this topic will be extended.

## Tests

The framework will be tested in a multimedia production environment. More on this soon...
